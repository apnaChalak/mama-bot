Poultry fountains or automatic watering  units are used to keep water clean and to avoid spillage. In winters  water heaters are recommended to avoid to freezing of water.\n\n\n\n•    Feeding baby chicks: Chicks need starter mash or crumbles  as starting food which is good for their growth and development. The  mash includes equal ratio (50:50) of rolled oats and corn meal. A baby  chick requires not more than 28% protein. Supplement the chicks with  brewer’s yeast @2cups per 10lb of chick starter.\n\n\n\n•    General feeding: Commercial feeds are given to  turkeys which contain animal by-products and antibiotics but this feed  is harmful for turkeys. So homemade feed is recommended to be given. A  beginner turkey requires 22-24% of protein content in their feed, a  grower/ finisher turkey i.e. when it reaches 5-8 weeks of age they  require 20% protein in the feed and an adult turkey requires 16% protein  content in the feed. Try to give the feed in feed container which is  heavy and small. Container must be heavy so that tipping doesn’t occur  and small so that turkeys will not stand on feed as it will lead to  contamination.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

A garage must be at least 20-20feet in size so that  it will be easy for you to walk comfortably inside the garage. The floor  must be covered with mats which are slip-resistant and shelter must be  waterproof and well ventilated. The shelter must be thoroughly cleaned  once in a week and wet or soiled bedding must be removed daily. To  protect turkeys from predators, fencing is done which is 4-5 foot high.  Do not use chicken wire alone as fencing as it will break easily.\n\n\n\nCare of baby chicks: For good care of turkeys, they require nutritious  and healthy food and plenty of water. Raising baby chicks requires  proper attention and an incubator. Eggs are placed in incubator. For the  first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF  for every following week. Proper feed at proper interval of time must  be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the  brooder. Handling of chicks should be done carefully while taking out  from the incubator. After taking out chicks from the incubator, they are  placed in the brooder. \n\n\n\nRecommended vaccines: The recommended vaccines given to turkeys at different ages:\n\n•    Vaccination of New Castle disease-B1 strain is given to turkey when  it is one day old to prevent them from New Castle disease.\n\n•    Vaccination of Fowl Pox is given when turkey is in 4th and 5th week.\n\n•    Vaccination of New Castle Disease-R2B strain is given when turkey is in 6th week.\n\n•    Cholera vaccine is given when turkey is having age between 8th-10th weeks.

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

Broiler chick requires 23% protein, 1% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.5% phosphorus in their feed and layer chick requires 24% protein, 0.85% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.6% phosphorus in their feed. Starter chick (1-3 weeks old) requires 3.8-9.8 gram feed per day per quail, grower chick (4-6 weeks old) requires 14-18 gram feed per day per quail and layer chick (7 weeks old) requires 20 gram feed per day per quail.\n\n\n\nRegular feed: Nutritious food plays an important role in health, growth and overall production of quails. Mainly 20-30g of daily feed is consumed by an adult quail. Generally 27% of protein is required for baby quail and 22-24% of protein is required for adult quail.  \n\n\n\nFeed components: It is very easy to feed the quail. To feed the quail, it requires mixture of cake, sweet corn, pasta, rice, lettuce etc.  The other feed ingredients are maize, sorghum, groundnut cake, deoiled rice bran, sunflower cake, fishmeal, mineral mixture, shell grit, soya meal etc.\n\n\n\nWater: Along with healthy and nutritious feed, make sure to provide them clean and fresh water every time.  \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder. \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Broiler chick requires 23% protein, 1% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.5% phosphorus in their feed and layer chick requires 24% protein, 0.85% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.6% phosphorus in their feed. Starter chick (1-3 weeks old) requires 3.8-9.8 gram feed per day per quail, grower chick (4-6 weeks old) requires 14-18 gram feed per day per quail and layer chick (7 weeks old) requires 20 gram feed per day per quail.\n\n\n\nRegular feed: Nutritious food plays an important role in health, growth and overall production of quails. Mainly 20-30g of daily feed is consumed by an adult quail. Generally 27% of protein is required for baby quail and 22-24% of protein is required for adult quail.  \n\n\n\nFeed components: It is very easy to feed the quail. To feed the quail, it requires mixture of cake, sweet corn, pasta, rice, lettuce etc.  The other feed ingredients are maize, sorghum, groundnut cake, deoiled rice bran, sunflower cake, fishmeal, mineral mixture, shell grit, soya meal etc.\n\n\n\nWater: Along with healthy and nutritious feed, make sure to provide them clean and fresh water every time.

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

Broiler chick requires 23% protein, 1% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.5% phosphorus in their feed and layer chick requires 24% protein, 0.85% calcium, 0.5% methionine and 0.6% phosphorus in their feed. Starter chick (1-3 weeks old) requires 3.8-9.8 gram feed per day per quail, grower chick (4-6 weeks old) requires 14-18 gram feed per day per quail and layer chick (7 weeks old) requires 20 gram feed per day per quail.\n\n\n\nRegular feed: Nutritious food plays an important role in health, growth and overall production of quails. Mainly 20-30g of daily feed is consumed by an adult quail. Generally 27% of protein is required for baby quail and 22-24% of protein is required for adult quail.  \n\n\n\nFeed components: It is very easy to feed the quail. To feed the quail, it requires mixture of cake, sweet corn, pasta, rice, lettuce etc.  The other feed ingredients are maize, sorghum, groundnut cake, deoiled rice bran, sunflower cake, fishmeal, mineral mixture, shell grit, soya meal etc.\n\n\n\nWater: Along with healthy and nutritious feed, make sure to provide them clean and fresh water every time.\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder.\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Starter chick (1-3 weeks old) requires 3.8-9.8 gram feed per day per quail, grower chick (4-6 weeks old) requires 14-18 gram feed per day per quail and layer chick (7 weeks old) requires 20 gram feed per day per quail.\n\n\n\nRegular feed: Nutritious food plays an important role in health, growth and overall production of quails. Mainly 20-30g of daily feed is consumed by an adult quail. Generally 27% of protein is required for baby quail and 22-24% of protein is required for adult quail.  \n\n\n\nFeed components: It is very easy to feed the quail. To feed the quail, it requires mixture of cake, sweet corn, pasta, rice, lettuce etc.  The other feed ingredients are maize, sorghum, groundnut cake, deoiled rice bran, sunflower cake, fishmeal, mineral mixture, shell grit, soya meal etc.\n\n\n\nWater: Along with healthy and nutritious feed, make sure to provide them clean and fresh water every time.  \n\n \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

The place must be minimum space of 1 square foot. The average temperature should be 15-20oC and humidity should be 40-70%. The room must be well ventilated, dust free and insulated.  There are two ways of housing management: \n\n•    Deep Litter system:  Quails require relatively small floor space. In this system, 4-6 birds can be reared per square feet.  After 2 weeks they can be reared in cages. \n\n•    Cage System:  The size of cages should be 3 ft × 2.5 ft × 1.5 ft, for first two weeks. It can accommodate about 100 quails.  From 3-6 weeks age, cages of size 4ft × 2.5ft × 1.5ft will accommodate 50 quails. Each unit should have 6 feet length and 1 feet width, which should be divided into 6 sub-units.  Cage box should be fixed with wooden plates. Proper ventilation is very necessary in the farm. Long narrow feed troughs should be provided in front of cages. \n\nProper care should be taken of chicks in first 3 months when they are critical. The weight of 1 day old chick is 7-8g. Give approximately 27% of protein in first 3 weeks and then after 3 weeks, the protein content must be 24% and 2800kilo calorie/kg of molybdenum energy is required. \n\n\n\nCare of egg laying quails: Mainly female quails lay eggs between 7-22 weeks of age. Mainly quail lay eggs in evening time of the day. 16 hours light/day must be required to egg laying quails. \n\n\n\nCare of quail chicks: Mainly one day old chick has approximately 8-10gm of weight. More temperature is required for the care of baby chicks. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

The shelter should be at some height from the road so that rain water will easily flow out and it will also protect them from the flood. Fresh water supply must be there. It must have 24 hours electricity supply. The chicken shelter must be away from the industrial and urban area because the fertilizer of chicken will pollute the environment and causes flies’ problem. Chose the shelter which is free from noise as the noise problem will affect the production of birds. The smoke of factories will also affect the birds.\n\n \n\nCare of newborn chicks: Raising baby chicks requires proper attention and an incubator. Eggs are placed in incubator for about 21 days by giving suitable temperature. After hatching, chicks are removed form incubator after 48 hours. Handling of chicks should be done carefully while taking out from the incubator. After taking out chicks from the incubator, they are placed in the brooder. For the first week the temperature of brooder must be 95oF and it must be dropped by 5oF for every following week. Proper feed at proper must be given to chicks and clean water must be available every time in the brooder. \n\n\n\nRecommended vaccines: Updated vaccines are also required for their good growth. Some major vaccines or medicines which are required for maintaining chicken’s good health are as follows:\n\n•    When the chick is one day old give them HVT vaccination to protect them from Marek’s disease. The influence of injection will remain up to 18 months. \n\n•    When the chick is 4-7days old give them RD vaccination (F1 strain) to protect them from Ranikhet disease. The influence of this injection will remain for 2-4 months. \n\n•    When the chick is 18-21days old give them IBD vaccination to protect them from Gumboro disease. \n\n•    When the chick is 4-5 weeks old give them RD (F1 strain) vaccination to protect them from Ranikhet disease. \n\n•    When the chick is 6-8 weeks old give them RD (F2B strain) vaccination to protect them from Ranikhet disease. 0.5ml of medicine is given to the chick.\n\n•    When the chick is 8-10 weeks old give them chicken pox vaccination to protect them from chicken pox disease. \n\n\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Mix 100g choline  chloride, 10,000 I U Vitamin E, 1.2mg Vitamin B12 and 100g incitol in 1  quintal of feed. \n\n\n\nAflatoxin:\n\nIt is mainly caused due to humidity and hot rains. The symptoms  are less hunger, less egg production, increased thirst and decrease in  blood level. \n\nTreatment: Livol or liv-52 or tefroli tonic is given in feed or given  through water. Vitamin A and Vitamin E @60,000 IU/acre and 300 IU/acre  is given respectively.\n\n                                        Show MoreShow Less"

The symptoms are paws turn inside.\n\nTreatment: Add Vitamin B2 in the feed.\n\n\n\nVitamin D deficiency:\n\nThe disease is mainly caused due to vitamin B2 deficiency or due to an imbalance of calcium and phosphorus in the body. \n\nTreatment: Add Vitamin D3 in the feed.\n \n\n\n\n\nChicken pox:\n\nIt is a contagious disease and it can be spread in any age of the bird. The symptoms are sores on a comb, around eyes and ears. \n\nTreatment: Homeopathic medicine of antimonium torterix @5ml/100 birds is given to cure chicken pox.\n \n \n\n\n\n\nCoccidiosis:\n\nIt is a parasitic disease which is caused by coccidian  protozoan. The disease is mainly caused to the chick having age between  3-10 weeks. It also affects the adult ones.\n\nTreatment: Proper cleaning should be done. Approximately up to 12 weeks  chick’s give coccidiostat in the feed, for eg befran or amprol @50g/qtl  feed, clopidol @125g/qtl, stanorol @50g/ton of feed. Change the medicine  after every 1-2 years. Mix the medicine properly in the feed. \n\n\n\nLeucosis and marek’s: \n\nIt is a contagious disease which is infected to another animal  via air, feathers, soil etc. Leucosis doesn’t spread through air and  doesn’t spread through the polluted environment.\n\nMarek’s symptoms: It is mainly caused to chicks having age between 1-4  months and sometime it is caused to 30 days old chicken. The symptoms  are fainted legs, feather and neck, grey color eyes and ultimately they  get blind.\n\nLeucosis symptoms: It is mainly caused to chicken having age more than 4  months. They symptoms are increase in liver in size and ulcers are  found in all body parts except veins. \n\nTreatment: When the chick is one day old vaccinate them with Marek’s vaccine. Proper cleanliness and care should be taken.  \n\n\n\nRanikhet disease:\n\nIt is also known as New Castle disease. It is a very contagious  disease and it is spread to every age bird. The symptoms are increased  death rate, difficulty in breathing, fainted legs and feathers. \n\nTreatment: When the chicks are 1-6 days old vaccinate it with Ranikhet  medicine of F strain and broilers should be vaccinate after 4 weeks  interval with F-1 vaccination.\n\n\n\nFatty liver syndrome (FLS): \n\nThe disease is mainly caused due to feed digestion problem  which causes fat deposition in the body. This disease is mainly found in  egg producing chicken or broiler which has given more energy feed. The  symptoms are 50% less egg production, weight reduces up to 20-25% and  blood spots are seen on liver and body.\n\nTreatment: Decrease the energy content in the feed. Mix 100g choline  chloride, 10,000 I U Vitamin E, 1.2mg Vitamin B12 and 100g incitol in 1  quintal of feed. \n\n\n\nAflatoxin:\n\nIt is mainly caused due to humidity and hot rains. The symptoms  are less hunger, less egg production, increased thirst and decrease in  blood level. \n\nTreatment: Livol or liv-52 or tefroli tonic is given in feed or given  through water. Vitamin A and Vitamin E @60,000 IU/acre and 300 IU/acre  is given respectively.\n\n                                        Show MoreShow Less"

In winters, hives should be kept near trees or any other shelter to protect them from chilly winds.\n\n \n\nManagement:\n\n\n\nSpring season (mid-February- mid-April) management: This is also known as honey flow season. As the season came, unpack the honey bee colonies. At the starting of the season, check the colonies at noon time on clear sunny day. As the colonies will rise provide them adequate food and space. Provide adequate feed (mainly solution of sugar and soil in the ratio of 1:2) for good growth and development of colonies. The dense colonies will destroy the swarms. Divide the colonies in a way so that swarms get proper space for living. Combs older than 3 years and queen older than one and a half year should be removed. Spring season is best for the multiplication of colony, mass queen bee rearing, pollen collection and royal jelly production.\n\n\n\nSummer season (mid-April – June): Provide them adequate amount of water and shade for the survival of bees. The bees have to survive from dearth rate (honey yield is minimum) in this season.\n\n\n\nMonsoon season (July – mid-September): Ensure that there is no wetness in apiary site. It should have proper drainage system. Provide them feed of sugar syrup. If colonies are short of pollens, then give them pollen substitute (having mixture of 42gm brewer’s yeast + 4gm skinned milk powder kneaded with 50g of 50% aq. Sugar solution + 4gm parched gram flour) by adding 10% pollen substitute.\n\n \n\nAutumn season (mid-September – November): Autumn season is known as the second best season for colonies multiplication. The colonies mainly migrate to pigeon pea, toria, guava and ber crops. At the end of November, bees give good honey yield. Take all the measures same as taken in spring season. At the end of monsoon, shift colonies slowly to the sunny places.\n\n\n\nWinter season (December - mid-February): For brood rearing, shift colonies to Raya (sarson) growing and sunny areas. Check the weaker colonies, merge them with stronger ones. Give weak colonies supplementary feed of sugar: water@2:1w/w. place the hives in south east to protect them from chilly winds.\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

They attack the live colonies of bees and stored combs. The larvae of the wax moths eat the combs. The symptoms are black faecal pellets on the abdomen.\n\n \n\nManagement: Surplus combs are placed in chambers. Fumigation of chambers is done in air-tight conditions with burning Sulphur@250gm/m3 of chamber area. Treatment is done after every 15 days of interval. \n\n\n\nBrood mite: The pest is Tropilaelaps clareare. The symptoms are sunken or punctured brood cells, bees have malformed and twisted wings and the pupae is seen lying dead on the ground in the front of the hive. \n\n \n\nManagement: Dust of powdered Sulphur@1gm/comb is done or formic acid (85%) @5ml/day is done at the interval of 14 days to treat the brood mites.\n\n\n\nVarroa mite: They are brown to dark brown in color and have shiny body mites. The symptoms are bald patches on brood cells, death of smaller bees is found in the front of hive and malformed wings or legs and shortened abdomen is seen on bees.\n\n \n\nManagement: Treatment with formic acid (85%) @5ml/day is done continuously for 2 weeks. Alternatively, oxalic acid@5ml is used between every two combs of bees at the weekly interval for 3 weeks. Alternatively, dusting finely ground sugar@20gm/10bees is also done in the late evening to treat the Varroa mites. \n\n\n\nWasps: These are brown color wasps having yellow spots on the body. They attach the bee colonies by catching bees in the post monsoon i.e. in July-November and monsoon season with the peak activity in the September month in the Punjab regions.\n\n\n\nManagement: Use of plastic wasp traps or large nylon mesh or fixing queen guard in apiary will help to catch the wasps and not entering into the hives. \n\n\n\nBlack ants: If ants attack is major then it will lead to death of whole colony of bees. \n\n\n\nManagement: Firstly drenching with pesticides is done and then cover it with dry soil to destroy the ants nest. \n\n\n\nBee eating birds: Green bee eater and king crow will destroy the colonies by catching the flying bees or queen bees. Green bee eater is more serious towards attacking as it attacks the whole flock in apiary.\n\n\n\nManagement: Use of tinsel tapes, nets or birds scarer is done to scare away the birds.\n\n\n\nDisease and their management:\n\n\n\nEuropean Foulbrood (EFB): It is a bacterial disease which affects the larvae present in open cells. First they turn from dull white to yellowish white in color and then later on brownish yellow to brownish in color. The symptoms are soft and pasty larvae, body segmentation gets faint and ultimately death of larvae. \n\n\n\nManagement: Shook swarm method along with the antibiotics is the promising method to get rid of EFB disease. Alternatively requeening and destruction of infected colonies are also used.\n\n\n\nSacbrood (SBV): It is a viral disease which affects the prepual or very late larval stages. The symptoms are pointer and darker dead larva heads. The infected larva turns greyish in color and then to straw color and ultimately dark in color. \n\n                                        Show MoreShow Less"

In winters, hives should be kept near trees or   any other shelter to protect them from chilly winds.\n\n \n\nManagement:\n\n\n\nSpring season (mid-February- mid-April) management: This is   also known as honey flow season. As the season came, unpack the honey   bee colonies. At the starting of the season, check the colonies at noon   time on clear sunny day. As the colonies will rise provide them  adequate  food and space. Provide adequate feed (mainly solution of  sugar and  soil in the ratio of 1:2) for good growth and development of  colonies.  The dense colonies will destroy the swarms. Divide the  colonies in a way  so that swarms get proper space for living. Combs  older than 3 years  and queen older than one and a half year should be  removed. Spring  season is best for the multiplication of colony, mass  queen bee rearing,  pollen collection and royal jelly production.\n\n\n\nSummer season (mid-April – June): Provide them adequate   amount of water and shade for the survival of bees. The bees have to   survive from dearth rate (honey yield is minimum) in this season.\n\n\n\nMonsoon season (July – mid-September): Ensure that   there is no wetness in apiary site. It should have proper drainage   system. Provide them feed of sugar syrup. If colonies are short of   pollens, then give them pollen substitute (having mixture of 42gm   brewer’s yeast + 4gm skinned milk powder kneaded with 50g of 50% aq.   Sugar solution + 4gm parched gram flour) by adding 10% pollen   substitute.\n\n \n\nAutumn season (mid-September – November): Autumn season   is known as the second best season for colonies multiplication. The   colonies mainly migrate to pigeon pea, toria, guava and ber crops. At   the end of November, bees give good honey yield. Take all the measures   same as taken in spring season. At the end of monsoon, shift colonies   slowly to the sunny places.\n\n\n\nWinter season (December - mid-February): For brood   rearing, shift colonies to Raya (sarson) growing and sunny areas. Check   the weaker colonies, merge them with stronger ones. Give weak colonies   supplementary feed of sugar: water@2:1w/w. place the hives in south  east  to protect them from chilly winds.\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

They attack the live colonies of bees and stored combs. The larvae of  the wax moths eat the combs. The symptoms are black faecal pellets on  the abdomen.\n\n \n\nManagement: Surplus combs are placed in chambers. Fumigation of chambers is done in air-tight conditions with burning Sulphur@250gm/m3 of chamber area. Treatment is done after every 15 days of interval. \n\n\n\nBrood mite: The pest is Tropilaelaps clareare. The symptoms are  sunken or punctured brood cells, bees have malformed and twisted wings  and the pupae is seen lying dead on the ground in the front of the hive.  \n\n \n\nManagement: Dust of powdered Sulphur@1gm/comb is done or formic  acid (85%) @5ml/day is done at the interval of 14 days to treat the  brood mites.\n\n\n\nVarroa mite: They are brown to dark brown in color and have  shiny body mites. The symptoms are bald patches on brood cells, death of  smaller bees is found in the front of hive and malformed wings or legs  and shortened abdomen is seen on bees.\n\n \n\nManagement: Treatment with formic acid (85%) @5ml/day is done  continuously for 2 weeks. Alternatively, oxalic acid@5ml is used between  every two combs of bees at the weekly interval for 3 weeks.  Alternatively, dusting finely ground sugar@20gm/10bees is also done in  the late evening to treat the Varroa mites. \n\n\n\nWasps: These are brown color wasps having yellow spots on the  body. They attach the bee colonies by catching bees in the post monsoon  i.e. in July-November and monsoon season with the peak activity in the  September month in the Punjab regions.\n\n\n\nManagement: Use of plastic wasp traps or large nylon mesh or  fixing queen guard in apiary will help to catch the wasps and not  entering into the hives. \n\n\n\nBlack ants: If ants attack is major then it will lead to death of whole colony of bees. \n\n\n\nManagement: Firstly drenching with pesticides is done and then cover it with dry soil to destroy the ants nest. \n\n\n\nBee eating birds: Green bee eater and king crow will destroy  the colonies by catching the flying bees or queen bees. Green bee eater  is more serious towards attacking as it attacks the whole flock in  apiary.\n\n\n\nManagement: Use of tinsel tapes, nets or birds scarer is done to scare away the birds.\n\n\n\nDisease and their management:\n\n\n\nEuropean Foulbrood (EFB): It is a bacterial disease which  affects the larvae present in open cells. First they turn from dull  white to yellowish white in color and then later on brownish yellow to  brownish in color. The symptoms are soft and pasty larvae, body  segmentation gets faint and ultimately death of larvae. \n\n\n\nManagement: Shook swarm method along with the antibiotics is  the promising method to get rid of EFB disease. Alternatively requeening  and destruction of infected colonies are also used.\n\n\n\nSacbrood (SBV): It is a viral disease which affects the prepual  or very late larval stages. The symptoms are pointer and darker dead  larva heads. The infected larva turns greyish in color and then to straw  color and ultimately dark in color. \n\n                                        Show MoreShow Less"

It is native to India and is distributed only to plain regions and hills below 450 MSL. It is the smallest bee among all Apis species. They built single vertical combs. They built their hives in caves, empty cases, hedges, bushes, buildings etc. They frequently change their place from one to another therefore they are not domestic bees. It gives an average yield of 200-900gm/colony/year of honey.  \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

This fish is mostly found in derelict and swampy waters. Magur is rather hardy fish and can live out of water for quite some time and move short distances. This fish is of great demand due to high market value in India and Bangladesh. Meat of this fish contains high protein and iron content whereas fat content is very low. These fish species can be kept alive for long time in water container without giving any food because these fishes bear special accessory respiratory organ. It is fed on commercial feed or homemade feed which include mustard oil cake (soaked for 24 hours before use) which is mixed with feed. It can be harvested after 6-8 months if proper care is taken. At rearing time the weight of Magur catfish is 120-140g. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

In 1959 ban was imposed on tilapia by the fisheries research committee of India, but recently its farming was approved with certain conditions in some states. Tilapia has high demand to fish farmers and consumers because of its fast growing feature. Tilapia fish prefers to live in shallow water. It is omnivores in nature that feeds upon phytoplankton, aquatic plants and small invertebrates. It is fed with artificial and floating pelleted feed. Its popularity is increasing day by day in local farmers and even in international markets because of its disease resistant quality, it can survive in adverse conditions and has an efficiency of eating natural feed. The feed conversion rate of Tilapia fish is 1.25-1.5. It can be harvested after 5-6 months and have 500-600g of weight at the time of harvesting if proper care is taken. Mainly 20,000-25,000 can be reared in per acre area. \n\n\n\n\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Its color is olive-brown on dorsal side, with silver sides and belly color is white. Scales are large with dark edging. These are river fish and have desire to move from still waters into flowing waters. This fish is herbivorous in nature and feeds upon various water weed species. It is a fish of large turbid rivers and associated floodplain lakes. It has wide degree of temperature tolerance i.e. 0-40°C.Its color is olive-brown on dorsal side, sides are silver and belly is white colored. These species has longer life duration. Grass is popular in various countries because these offer a biological alternative to aquatic weed control. In India this fish is prepared to lay eggs in the month of May and June.Depending upon their per kg weight it gives 0.80-1.00kg eggs. This breed eats 40-70% of feed according to their weight.Approximately 24000 silver carp fish can be reared in per acre space. If the size of fingerling at the time of stocking is 13-15cm in length. Then depending upon the water and other conditions, it attains the weight of 0.5-1.5kg in 8-10months. At the time of harvesting the size of carp is 1-1.5kg in ponds and 1.5-2.5kg in cages. \n\n\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

For fish farm some points should be kept in mind such as the land should have water holding capacity, don’t make pond on sandy and loamy soil. If you want to do soil testing then at that land dig 1 foot wide and deep hole and fill it with water. If the water remains in the hole for 1-2 days then it is good for fish farming but if no water remain in the hole then it is not good for fish farming. Mainly 3 types of pool are there i.e. Nursery pool, Rearing pool and Production pool.\n\n\n\nFertilizer management: Mainly organic and inorganic fertilizers are used in aquaculture. \n\n•    Inorganic or mineral fertilizers: It contains mineral nutrients which are manufactured in industries and material is taken from agricultural fields. It mainly includes animal manure, chicken manure and some other organic materials. Organic materials such as composts, grass, sewage, and rice bran. \n\n•    Organic fertilizers: It contains mixture of both mineral nutrients and organic matter. It is manufactured mainly by the local people, which include farm animal waste and agriculture waste. It mainly consists of at least one of these plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and/or potassium.\n\n\n\nCare of baby fish: Remove the fish from the adult fish tank with the help of scoop or cup. Baby fish must be given few drops of infusoria which is a liquid diet with the help of eyedropper several times a day. After some days when they reaches half inch in size it is placed in new tank which has enough space for them to grow.\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Mainly 3 types of pool are there i.e. Nursery pool, Rearing pool and Production pool.\n\n\n\nFertilizer management: Mainly organic and inorganic fertilizers are used in aquaculture. \n\n•    Inorganic or mineral fertilizers: It contains mineral nutrients which are manufactured in industries and material is taken from agricultural fields. It mainly includes animal manure, chicken manure and some other organic materials. Organic materials such as composts, grass, sewage, and rice bran. \n\n•    Organic fertilizers: It contains mixture of both mineral nutrients and organic matter. It is manufactured mainly by the local people, which include farm animal waste and agriculture waste. It mainly consists of at least one of these plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and/or potassium.\n\n\n\nCare of baby fish: Remove the fish from the adult fish tank with the help of scoop or cup. Baby fish must be given few drops of infusoria which is a liquid diet with the help of eyedropper several times a day. After some days when they reaches half inch in size it is placed in new tank which has enough space for them to grow.\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Lower body part and two sides are silver colored, back side is gray colored. Fins are slightly orange in color in larger specimens. It can tolerate minimum temperature of 14°C. Its average body length is about 1m. They usually livein lower water level and feeds on small insects, organic particles and decomposed organic element etc. It gives eggs once in a year during monsoon season. It is always marketed in fresh condition. It gives around 1.50-2.0 lakh eggs per kg of their weight.It is reared along with Rohu and catla fishes in equal proportions. This breed has an average 0.08 million per acre per year combined production. It is a slow growing fish but has more survival. If 10,000 fingerlings are stocked then the recovery of mrigal fish is about 9,500. In one year it attains the weight of 600-700gm.                                         Show MoreShow Less"

It is generally fish of south-east Asia but now it is available all over the world. It has flat body, small cane, small face which turns upwards and small eyes, its body color is silver and upper side is gray in color. They have tiny scales on their body but head and opercles are scale less. It takes its food from the upper layer of the water and its major food is phytoplankton. It gains sexual maturity earlier than all other carp fishes. In India this fish is prepared to lay eggs in the month of May and June. It gives around 0.80-1.0 lakh eggs per kg of their weight. It usually feeds on upper water level and eats small plants, leaves and decomposed water plants. This species is known for leaping out of water when disturbed by any kind of motor boat or other noise.Approximately 20000 silver carp fish can be reared in per acre space. It gives an output of 6000-9000kg/year. It is a fastest growing which dominates other fishes. It attains upto 3-4kg of weight in single year. \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

This feed is available in the form of pellet i.e. wet pellet and dry pellet. In wet pellet, to make the feed hard Carboxy methyl cellulose or gelatin is added and then it is thinly crushed and prepared into pellets. It is healthy but it can’t be stored for long time. In Dry pellet, as it is stored for longer time, they are transported from one place to another. It contains 8-11% of moisture content. Dry pellet is of two types, one is sinking type and other is floating type. \n\n\n\nProtein: Mainly different breeds of fishes requires different amount of protein level in their diet for example marine shrimp requires 18-20% protein, catfish requires 28-32%, tilapia requires 32-38% and hybrid striped brass requires 38-42% protein in their feed.\n\n \n\nLipids: n-3 HUFA is required in the diet as a lipid for the optimal growth and health of marine fishes. \n\n\n\nCarbohydrates: Carbohydrates are the major energy source in mammals. About 20% of carbohydrates are required in fish feed.\n\n \n\nFeed types: There are two types of feed available i.e. floating and sinking feed. Different breeds of fishes prefer different feed for example shrimp will only eat shrinking feed. Feed is available in the form of pellets ranging in different sizes according to the size of the fishes.\n\n\n\nMedicated feeds: Medicated feeds are used when fish stops eating the feed or fall ill.

The teeth of rabbit grows continuously therefore it   requires both type of feeds i.e. concentrate and green fodder. 1kg   rabbit requires 40gm of concentrated feed and 40gm of green fodder per   day. Rabbits take their feed only at day time. The concentrate feed   should be given in the form of pellets by making small balls of it. The   feed should be given according to the size and weight of the rabbit as   given below: \n\n•    Adult male rabbit having weight of approximately  4-5kg should be  given 100gm of concentrate feed and 250gm of green  fodder per day. \n\n•    Adult female rabbit having weight of  approximately 4-5kg should be  given 100gm of concentrate feed and 300gm  of green fodder per day. \n\n•    Lactating and pregnant rabbit having  weight of approximately 4-5kg  should be given 150gm of concentrate feed  and 150gm of green fodder  per day. \n\n•    Young rabbits having weight  of approximately 0.6-0.7kg should be  given 50-75gm of concentrate feed  and 150gm of green fodder per day. \n\n\n\nSome other important consideration on feeding:\n\n•    Both types of feeds are given in equal amount. Don’t feed rabbits only concentrate feed. \n\n•    For good succulent feed give them vegetables such as green grass, turnip, lucerne, spinach, berseem etc. \n\n•    Kitchen waste such as carrot and cauliflower leaves should be given in the feed.\n\n•    The feed of does should be increased after 5-7 days of kindling. \n\n•    Clean and fresh water must be available all time in all seasons. \n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Three types  of housing systems can be made for rising rabbits i.e. hutch system,  cage system and floor system. In cage system the cages are made up of  wooden or galvanized wire mesh, in hutch system it contains  self-contained cage with roof on the top which can be moved from one  place to another and in floor system the floor is covered with litter  material.  \n\n\n\nCare of nursing does: The nursing does are kept in separate  cages. The noon meal of stale bread and milk should be included with  morning and evening meal. After birth of kits the doe is shifted to  peaceful place where there is no disturbance of dogs and children.\n\n \n\nCare of new born kits: The newborn kits are blind and  hairless. Their hair starts growing in 4th day and they open their eyes  after 10th day. When the kits are around 21-23 days old they start  coming out of the nest and start nibbling and when the kits are around 1  month old they start taking proper feed. \n\n\n\nRecommended vaccines:\n\n•    Combined vaccination of RMD and Myxomatosis is given to 5 weeks old  rabbit. This vaccination is given at the interval of 1 year. \n\n•    Vaccination of RHD2 is given after every 6-12 months. The RHD2  vaccination is given 2 weeks apart from RMD and Myxomatosis vaccination.                                        Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its  symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing,  grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal  medicine to control the insect population. Serological test is done to  check the anaplasmosis disease. If the result is positive then immediate  treatment is given by qualified veterinary doctor.\n\n\nAnemia: The  symptoms are muscular weakness, depression, anorexia and increased heat  rate. The disease is caused due to poor nutrition management,  inadequate nutrients in diet and colostrum intake.\nTreatment: Vitamins A, B and E is given in the diet and injection of iron dextrin @150mg is given to cure the anaemia.\n\n\nFoot-and-mouth: The  disorder is an extremely communicable influencing cloven-footed pets or  animals. This is indicated by fever, growth of vesicles as well as  blisters in the udder, oral, teats and even on the dermis between the  paws also above the hoofs. Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The  disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living  conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The  symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is  caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates,  licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver. It is generally  caused by using unhygienic knife/blade and improper dressing of navel.\nTreatment: Do proper dressing of navel cord and if external injury is seen, do proper dressing.\n \n \n \n \n\nRing worm: It  is the most common skin infectious infecting beef cattle. This is a  fungus infection, which is transmissible to humans also. Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its  symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing,  grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal  medicine to control the insect population. Serological test is done to  check the anaplasmosis disease. If the result is positive then immediate  treatment is given by qualified veterinary doctor.\n\n\nAnemia: The  symptoms are muscular weakness, depression, anorexia and increased heat  rate. The disease is caused due to poor nutrition management,  inadequate nutrients in diet and colostrum intake.\nTreatment: Vitamins A, B and E is given in the diet and injection of iron dextrin @150mg is given to cure the anaemia.\n\n\nFoot-and-mouth: The  disorder is an extremely communicable influencing cloven-footed pets or  animals. This is indicated by fever, growth of vesicles as well as  blisters in the udder, oral, teats and even on the dermis between the  paws also above the hoofs. Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The  disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living  conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The  symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is  caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates,  licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver. It is generally  caused by using unhygienic knife/blade and improper dressing of navel.\nTreatment: Do proper dressing of navel cord and if external injury is seen, do proper dressing.\n \n \n \n \n\nRing worm: It  is the most common skin infectious infecting beef cattle. This is a  fungus infection, which is transmissible to humans also. Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin.

Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its  symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing,  grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal  medicine to control the insect population. Serological test is done to  check the anaplasmosis disease. If the result is positive then immediate  treatment is given by qualified veterinary doctor.\n\n\nAnemia: The  symptoms are muscular weakness, depression, anorexia and increased heat  rate.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin.

Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given.

It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin.

Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin.

Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its  symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing,  grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal  medicine to control the insect population. Serological test is done to  check the anaplasmosis disease. If the result is positive then immediate  treatment is given by qualified veterinary doctor.\n\n\nAnemia: The  symptoms are muscular weakness, depression, anorexia and increased heat  rate. The disease is caused due to poor nutrition management,  inadequate nutrients in diet and colostrum intake.\nTreatment: Vitamins A, B and E is given in the diet and injection of iron dextrin @150mg is given to cure the anaemia.\n\n\nFoot-and-mouth: The  disorder is an extremely communicable influencing cloven-footed pets or  animals. This is indicated by fever, growth of vesicles as well as  blisters in the udder, oral, teats and even on the dermis between the  paws also above the hoofs. Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The  disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living  conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The  symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is  caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates,  licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver. It is generally  caused by using unhygienic knife/blade and improper dressing of navel.\nTreatment: Do proper dressing of navel cord and if external injury is seen, do proper dressing.\n \n \n \n \n\nRing worm: It  is the most common skin infectious infecting beef cattle. This is a  fungus infection, which is transmissible to humans also. Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing, grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal medicine to control the insect population.

This is indicated by fever, growth of vesicles as well as blisters in the udder, oral, teats and even on the dermis between the paws also above the hoofs. Mammals restored from the disorder display a specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay. It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva, lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion. Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement, Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine. They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF. Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms. Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months. These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season. The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing.

High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin.

Deworming is required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale.

The disease is caused due to poor nutrition management, inadequate nutrients in diet and colostrum intake.\nTreatment: Vitamins A, B and E is given in the diet and injection of iron dextrin @150mg is given to cure the anaemia.\n\n\nFoot-and-mouth: The disorder is an extremely communicable influencing cloven-footed pets or animals. This is indicated by fever, growth of vesicles as well as blisters in the udder, oral, teats and even on the dermis between the paws also above the hoofs. Mammals restored from the disorder display a specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay. It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva, lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion. Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement, Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine. They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF. Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms. Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months. These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season. The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates, licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver. It is generally caused by using unhygienic knife/blade and improper dressing of navel.\nTreatment: Do proper dressing of navel cord and if external injury is seen, do proper dressing.\n \n \n \n \n\nRing worm: It is the most common skin infectious infecting beef cattle. This is a fungus infection, which is transmissible to humans also. Generally the infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness.

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality  in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are  the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The  microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease  generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or  ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire  within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting  anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores.  Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless,  can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute  form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The  antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,  tetracycline and penicillin.   \n\n\nAnaplasmosis: It  is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its  symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing,  grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal  medicine to control the insect population. Serological test is done to  check the anaplasmosis disease. If the result is positive then immediate  treatment is given by qualified veterinary doctor.\n\n\nAnemia: The  symptoms are muscular weakness, depression, anorexia and increased heat  rate. The disease is caused due to poor nutrition management,  inadequate nutrients in diet and colostrum intake.\nTreatment: Vitamins A, B and E is given in the diet and injection of iron dextrin @150mg is given to cure the anaemia.\n\n\nFoot-and-mouth: The  disorder is an extremely communicable influencing cloven-footed pets or  animals.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a  specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In  India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight  communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, and hay.  It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread  via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva,  lameness is seen.\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For  the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion.  Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles  should be used to control the files and spore.\n\n\nHypomagnesaemia: The  symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement,  Incoordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly  caused when calves are fed only on milk.\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\n \n\n\nLead poisoning: Sunken  abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead  poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted  tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\n Rinderpest: This  is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Some time ago there was  no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of  the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the  Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw  from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.  They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile  period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the  liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun  rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain  this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and  fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107oF.  Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms.  Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is  discovered.\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\n \n Black Quarter: This  bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on  livestock. Cattle are mostly infected in the young age of 6-24 months.  These are sporadic infection mainly born from soil during rainy season.  The animal suffer from high fever, difficulty in breathing. Loss of  appetite, dullness. High pulse and heart rate.        \nTreatment:\n1) High dose of Oxytetracycline i.e. 5-10 mg/Kg body weight 1M or IV.\n2) Injection of Avil / Cadistin @ 5-10 ml IM.\n3) Penicillin @ 10,000 units /Kg body weight 1M & locally daily for 5-6 days.\n4) B.Q. antiserum in large does.\n\n\nCalf pneumonia/ Enzootic bronchitis: The  calf pneumonia is mainly caused by wet floors or beddings. It is caused  by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella,  Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also  be infected by the contact with infected animal.\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\n \n\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In  this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and  dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due  to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding  systems.\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\n \n\nEctoparasites: The  symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The  disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living  conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The  symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is  caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates,  licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is  required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose  of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This  disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal  disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds  stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes  (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis.  Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then  distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the  teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic  treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and  acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and  streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The  symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee  joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver. It is generally  caused by using unhygienic knife/blade and improper dressing of navel.\nTreatment: Do proper dressing of navel cord and if external injury is seen, do proper dressing.\n \n \n \n \n\nRing worm: It  is the most common skin infectious infecting beef cattle. This is a  fungus infection, which is transmissible to humans also. Generally the  infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as  collar and even around the eyes.\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the  infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as  well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the  cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended  thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly.  Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper  as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate  with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this  infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as  assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due  to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot  rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most  often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to  acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather  scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws  as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

The disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living conditions.\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\n \n \n \n\n\nEndoparasites: The symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates, licking of walls, infested floors etc.\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\n \n Mastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\n \n Navel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n \n Foot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.    \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\n\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin.   \nAnaplasmosis: It is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, hay. It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva, lameness is seen.\n\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion. Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles should be used to control the files and spore.\nHypomagnesaemia: The symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement, Inco-ordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly caused when calves are fed only on milk.\n\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\nLead poisoning: Sunken abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\n\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\nRinderpest: This is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock.

In case the infection turns into a herd condition a foot shower possessing a 5% mixture of copper sulphate should be inserted everyplace where cattle are compelled to move 1 - 2 times per day can help to minimize the range of other diseases. Additionally, deplete slush holes as well as concrete zones around the fluid feed box where the cattle often acquire the infection. Thoroughly cleans the pens as well as places where the cattle assemble. Sufficient nourishment related to proteins, vitamins and minerals can improve hoof condition.       \n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\n\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin.   \nAnaplasmosis: It is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale.

The infection develops by straight communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, hay. It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva, lameness is seen.\n\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion. Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles should be used to control the files and spore.\nHypomagnesaemia: The symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement, Inco-ordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly caused when calves are fed only on milk.\n\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\nLead poisoning: Sunken abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\n\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\nRinderpest: This is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Sometime ago there was no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine. They are within the circulating bloodstream throughout the febrile period and afterward target to several body parts, specifically in the liver, lymph nodes as well as spleen. They are demolished by direct sun rays as well as disinfectants outside the body. Cold conditions sustain this viral infection. The virus is generally spread by polluted food and fluid. Show increased body temp about 104 – 107 Degree Fahrenheit. Lacrimation as well as itchiness of eyes is some of its symptoms. Unpleasant odour comes from oral cavity. Bloody mucoid diarrhea is discovered.\n\nTreatment: It can be treated with sulphadimidine, streptomycin or penicillin but when they are controlled on primary level.\nBlack Quarter: This bacterial infection is a severe infection with lethal effects on livestock.

It is caused by infectious agents such as Parainfluenza herpesrvirus, Pasteurella, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Mycoplasma etc. and can also be infected by the contact with infected animal.\n\nTreatment: Proper dry bedding and proper ventilation is required.\nEnteritis/ Diarrhoea/ Calf scours: In this disease first the excessive loss of water occur then acidosis and dehydration and then death of the animal. The disease mainly occurs due to unclean hygiene conditions, drinking unclean water and poor feeding systems.\n\nTreatment: Clean the hygiene conditions. Treat with nitrofurazone @20mg/kg or with trimethoprim and sulphadoxin to cure from disease.\nEctoparasites: The symptoms are itching, excitement, irritation and abscesses on skin. The disease is mainly caused by unclean surroundings and wet living conditions.\n\nTreatment: Application of coconut/peanut oil (3:1) mixed in Sulphur is used to cure disease.\nEndoparasites: The symptoms are diarrhoea, bottle jaw, listlessness etc. the disease is caused mainly because of unhealthy surroundings and ingestion of gates, licking of walls, infested floors etc.\n\nTreatment: Give clean drinking water. Deworming is required firstly at 2 weeks and then at the interval of 6 months. Dose of sulphamethazine/sulphadimidine is given to cure disease.\nMastitis: This disease the inflammation of mammary gland and is significantly lethal disease of livestock in worldwide. Though pressure or external wounds stimulates swelling of the gland, contamination by invading microbes (yeasts, fungi and even viruses) are the major source of mastitis. Diseases activate once the microbes permeate the teat canal then distribute in the mammary gland.\n\nTreatment: Mastitis can be controlled by dipping the teat in germicide after each milking. Heifers are given antibiotic treatment while gestation. Drugs such as gramicidin, Tyrothricin and acriflavine are the effective drugs. Penicillin, sulphonamides and streptomycin are few other effective drugs used for its treatment.\nNavel-ill: The symptoms are loss of appetite, swollen and painful hock and knee joints, elevated temperature and infection in liver.

Wash the cattle which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\nFoot rot: Foot rot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattle are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.\n\nTreatment: Unique cases must be confined to an arid place as well as handled instantly with medicines as instructed by a vets. In case the infection turns into a herd condition a foot shower possessing a 5% mixture of copper sulphate should be inserted everyplace where cattle are compelled to move 1 - 2 times per day can help to minimize the range of other diseases. Additionally, deplete slush holes as well as concrete zones around the fluid feed box where the cattle often acquire the infection. Thoroughly cleans the pens as well as places where the cattle assemble. Sufficient nourishment related to proteins, vitamins and minerals can improve hoof condition.       \n\n\n \n\n\n                                         Show MoreShow Less"

Anthrax is common in every region, leads to severe mortality in ruminants. The microbe generates incredibly strong toxins that are the cause of the bad impacts, leading to large number mortality. The microbe generates spores on exposure with air. Symptoms of the disease generally emerge in 4 to 7 days after the spores are either inhaled or ingested. As symptoms start appearing in animals, they often expire within a couple of days. They typically obtain the illness by ingesting anthrax spores when grazing on pasture infected with anthrax spores. Breathing the spores, that are colourless, odourless, even tasteless, can also induce infection in human as well as animals.\n\nTreatment: Treatment can be done only in sub-acute form of illness. They can be treated in early stage only. The antibiotics used for their treatment are Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin.   \nAnaplasmosis: It is an infectious disease which is caused by Anaplasma marginale. Its symptoms are increased body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing, grinding of teeth, inappetance, pale and icteric mucous membrane.\n\nTreatment: Spraying or dipping of acaricidal medicine to control the insect population.

Mammals restored from the disorder display a specifically irregular covering as well as deformation of the hoof. In India, this disorder is prevalent. The infection develops by straight communication even indirectly from contaminated manure, fluid, hay. It can also be transferred by cattle attendants. Sometime it can spread via retrieved livestock or by birds. High temperature, hanging saliva, lameness is seen.\n\nTreatment: Apply antiseptics for healing ulcers. For the feet lesion use copper sulphate and coal tar in 5:1 proportion. Recommended vaccines should be given. Proper care of sanitized vesicles should be used to control the files and spore.\nHypomagnesaemia: The symptoms are continuous movement of ears, hyper-excitement, Inco-ordination of gait, loss of urination etc. the disease is mainly caused when calves are fed only on milk.\n\nTreatment: Magnesium oxide @5g or magnesium carbonate @8g is added in the diet to get rid of hypomagnesaemia.\nLead poisoning: Sunken abdominal pain and calf is dull are the major symptoms of lead poisoning. It mainly occurs when they lick the metalwork, painted tarpaulins, lead batteries etc.\n\nTreatment: Dose of calcium versenate @25% twice a day is given to cure the lead poisoning in sub-acute cases.\nRinderpest: This is one of dangerous viral strain of livestock. Sometime ago there was no control, but organized efforts have brought a total elimination of the disorder in Western Hemisphere. The disorder even now endures in the Asian regions. The virus is located remarkable in the saliva; withdraw from eye sight as well as from nose, even in the feces as well as urine.

Foot rot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.\n\nTreatment: Unique cases must be confined to an arid place as well as handled instantly with medicines as instructed by a vets. In case the infection turns into a herd condition a foot shower possessing a 5% mixture of copper sulphate should be inserted everyplace where cattle are compelled to move 1 - 2 times per day can help to minimize the range of other diseases. Additionally, deplete slush holes as well as concrete zones around the fluid feed box where the cattle often acquire the infection. Thoroughly cleans the pens as well as places where the cattle assemble. Sufficient nourishment related to proteins, vitamins and minerals can improve hoof condition.       \n\n                                        Show MoreShow Less"

Generally the infection emerges as crusty grey spots often around the head as well as collar and even around the eyes.\n\nTreatment: As an initial step in managing the infection is, if possible, infected animals needs to be segregated as well as their pens even stalls cleaned up with disinfected. Wash the cattles which were infected with the infection, need to be attended thoroughly for the presence of scars as well as handled instantly. Adequate nourishment, especially excessive levels of Vitamin A, copper as well as zinc, aids to boost the stability of the animal. Communicate with the veterinarian as well as hook-up to shops for items to cure this infection. Applying a wormer such as Ivomec can destroy lice as well as assist in preventing cattle from itching which cause a skin injury due to which fungi can penetrate in.\n\n\n\nFoot rot: Footrot is a basic source of lameness in cattle as well as develops most often while cattles are on pasture and enforced to move from slush to acquire water as well as food. Footrot is stimulated while a cut rather scrape on the skin that permits disease to go through between the claws as well around the upper of the hoof.;  \n\nTreatment: Unique cases must be confined to a arid place as well as handled instantly with medicines as instructed by a vets. In case the infection turns into a herd condition a foot shower possessing a 5% mixture of copper sulphate should be inserted everyplace where cattles are compelled to move 1 - 2 times per day can help to minimize the range of other diseases. Additionally, deplete slush holes as well as concrete zones around the fluid feed box where the cattle often acquire the infection. Thoroughly cleans the pens as well as places where the cattle assemble. Sufficient nourishment related to proteins, vitamins and minerals can improve hoof condition.                                              Show MoreShow Less"
