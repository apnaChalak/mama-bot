Citrus canker bacteria can  enter through plant   s stomata into the leaves. Younger leaves are highly  susceptible. Lesions oozes bacterial cells which can be dispersed by  blowing wind to healthy plants in area.Contaminated equipment  tends to spread disease to healthy plants. Bacteria can stay viable in  old lesions for several months. It can be detected by appearance of  lesions. It can be controlled by cutting of effected branches, twigs by spraying of Bordeaux mixture @1%. Aqueous solution of 550ppm,  Streptomycin Sulphate is also helpful in controlling citrus canker.Show MoreShow Less, Gummosis: Exudation of gum from bark of tree is the  characteristic symptom of gummosis disease. Affected plant leaves turns  to pale yellow in color. Hardness masses of gum are common on stem and  leaf surfaces. In severe cases, bark may be destroyed by rotting and  tree may dies. Plant dies before the fruit matures. This disease is also  called foot rot. This disease can be managed through proper selection  of site with proper drainage, use of resistant varieties etc. Plant  injuries should be avoided. Drench the soil with 0.2% metalaxyl MZ-72 +  0.5% trichoderma viride, which help to control this disease. Bordeaux  mixture should be applied to plant upto 50-75 cm height from ground  level at least once in a year.Show MoreShow Less, Powdery mildew: White cottony powdery growth is  noticed on all aerial plant parts.

Twigs may die back, dense shoots having stunted bushy  appearance is commonly seen. Fruits tend to become pale, elongated and  small in size. Proper fertilizer application should be given to the  citrus tree to prevent zinc deficiency. Zinc sulphate should be provided  by dissolving 2 table spoons in 10 liters of water. This should be  sprayed thoroughly on all the tree branches and foliage. It can also be  cured by providing cow or sheep manure.Show MoreShow Less, Iron deficiency: Color of new leaves changes to  yellowish green. Iron chelates should be provided to the plants.

It injects a plant toxin liquid which burns  foliage and skin of fruit. Leaves curl and fall off prematurely. It can  be controlled by pruning of diseased plants, burning them. Spraying of  Monocrotophos-0.025% or carbaryl- 0.1% can also be helpful.Show MoreShow Less, Leaf miner: Larvae inside the upper or lower surface  of young and newly emerged leaves are curled and look distorted. Young  trees show a reduction in growth due to leaf miner. Best management for  leaf miner is to leave it alone and let the natural enemies to feed upon  them and parasitize their larvae. It can also be controlled by spraying  Phosphomidon @1ml or Monocrotophos @1.5ml per 3-4 times fortnightly.  Pheromone traps are also available for detecting leaf minor moths.Show MoreShow Less, Scale Insects: Citrus scale insects are small  insects that suck sap from the citrus trees and fruits. Honeydew is  produced which is feasted upon by ants. They do not have much mouth  parts. Male citrus scale has a short life span. There are mainly two  types of scale on citrus plants armored scale and soft scales.   Armored  scale insects insert their mouth parts in the plant and never move  again, eating and reproducing in the same spot. Soft scale bugs on  citrus form a protective coating, which in turns cover citrus leaves and  prevents photosynthesis. Once dead and soft scale will fall from tree  instead of remaining stuck. They can be controlled with the introduction  of indigenous parasitic wasps. Neem oil is also effective against them.  Spraying of Parathion (0.03%) emulsion, dimethoate 150ml or malathion  @0.1% are effective against scale control.Show MoreShow Less, Orange Shoot Borer: Freshly hatched larvae bore into twigs. They feed upon soft tissues. This insect feed upon trees in the day hours. Affected plants tend to lose its vigor. It is very serious pest of citrus plant. It can be controlled by destroying the affected branches. Kerosene oil/petrol injection can also help to control this insect. Monocrotophos (5ml/20ml of water) also helps to control orange shoot borer.Show MoreShow Less, Aphids & Mealy Bugs: They are small sap sucking  pests. Bugs are present on the underside of leaves. Synthetic  pyrethroids or pest oil can be used to control aphids and bugs.Show MoreShow Less, Disease and Their ManagementCitrus Canker: Plants have lesions on stems, leaves  and fruits with brown, water-soaked margins. Citrus canker bacteria can  enter through plant   s stomata into the leaves. Younger leaves are highly  susceptible. Lesions oozes bacterial cells which can be dispersed by  blowing wind to healthy plants in area.Contaminated equipment  tends to spread disease to healthy plants. Bacteria can stay viable in  old lesions for several months. It can be detected by appearance of  lesions. It can be controlled by cutting of effected branches, twigs.  Spraying of Bordeaux mixture @1%. Aqueous solution of 550ppm,  Streptomycin Sulphate is also helpful in controlling citrus canker.Show MoreShow Less, Gummosis: Exudation of gum from bark of tree is the  characteristic symptom of gummosis disease. Affected plant leaves turns  to pale yellow in color. Hardness masses of gum are common on stem and  leaf surfaces. In severe cases, bark may be destroyed by rotting and  tree may dies. Plant dies before the fruit matures. This disease is also  called foot rot. This disease can be managed through proper selection  of site with proper drainage, use of resistant varieties etc. Plant  injuries should be avoided. Drench the soil with 0.2% metalaxyl MZ-72 +  0.5% trichodermaviride, which helps to control this disease.

Leaves tend to become pale yellow and  crinkle. Distorted margins are also seen. Upper surface of leaves are  more affected. Young fruits drop off prematurely. Yield is reduced  significantly.   To control powdery mildew, affected plant parts should  be removed and destroyed completely. Carbendazim, three times at 20-22  days of interval helps to control this disease.Show MoreShow Less, Black Spot: Black spot is a fungal disease.  Circular, dark spots on fruits are seen. Copper spray in early spring  should be sprayed on foliage helps to cure plants from black spots. It  should be repeated in 6 weeks again.Show MoreShow Less, Collar Rot: Collar rot is also caused due to fungus.  This disease mainly affects the bark on tree trunk. Bark begins to rot  and forms a band just above ground surface, this band decay gradually  and covers the whole trunk. It is very severe in some cases that even  the trees may die. This is caused due to incorrect mulching, injury due  to weeding, mowing etc. Tree may lose its vigor. To protect trees from  collar rot, cut and scrape away the soft, infected bark to clean the  trunk of tree. Mixture of copper spray or Bordeaux mixture should be  painted on the affected part of the tree. Remove all the weak, diseased  and congested tree branches to ensure proper air circulation.Show MoreShow Less, Zinc Deficiency: It is very common in citrus trees.  It is notified as yellow areas between main lateral veins and midrib of  the leaves. Twigs may die back, dense shoots having stunted bushy  appearance is commonly seen. Fruits tend to become pale, elongated and  small in size. Proper fertilizer application should be given to the  citrus tree to prevent zinc deficiency. Zinc sulphate should be provided  by dissolving 2 table spoons in 10 liters of water. This should be  sprayed thoroughly on all the tree branches and foliage. It can also be  cured by providing cow or sheep manure.Show MoreShow Less, Iron deficiency: Color of new leaves changes to  yellowish green. Iron chelates should be provided to the plants. Cow or  Sheep manure is also helpful to cure plants from iron deficiency. This  deficiency mostly occurs in case of alkaline soils.Show MoreShow Less, Harvesting  On attaining proper size, shape along with attractive color having TSS to Acid ratio of 12:1, kinnow fruits is ready for harvest.

        "sowing": "Sowing Time of sowingIn Punjab, planting season of sugarcane is from September to October and February to March. Sugarcane takes generally one year to mature therefore called as Eksali. SpacingRow spacing is ranges from 60-120 cm for sub-tropical regions.Sowing DepthSow the sugarcane at depth of 3-4 cm and cover it with soil.Method of sowingA) For sowing use improved method of planting like deep furrow, trench method, paired row method or ring pit method.1) Dry planting in ridges and furrow: With the help of tractor drawn ridger, make ridges and furrows at distance of 90 cm. Plant sugarcane setts then cover it with soil. After then give light irrigation.  2) Paired row planting: Make Trenches at 150 cm distance using trenches opener. Plant sugarcane in paired row using 30:30-90-30:30cm spacing. It gives higher yield as compared to ridges and furrow.  3) Ring Pit method: Circular pits of 60 cm diameters are dug at depth of 30 cm with a tractor mounted digger. 60 cm gap is provided between adjacent pits. 2-3 ratoons can be taken. 25-50% higher yield can be obtained compared to ridge and furrow.  B) Single budded set planting: Select healthy setts for plantation. Make furrows at distance of 75-90 cm. Place single budded setts. If only small size setts from top portion of cane are selected then they are planted at distance of 6\"-9\". Place eye of sett on upward direction to ensure proper and quick germination. Cover setts with soil and apply light irrigation.Show MoreShow Less",
        "seed": "Seed Seed RateVarious research and experiment shows that, germination percentage of 3 bud sets is higher than the setts having more or less than three buds. Germination percentage of single bud sett is very low because of moisture loss from other cut end. Also if whole can stalk is planted without giving any cut, still germination percentage remain low as only top end will get germinate. Seed rate vary from region to region. In North West India, seed rate is high because of low germination percentage and adverse weather i.e hot weather with desiccating winds. Use seed rate of 20,000 three budded setts per acre.Seed TreatmentTake seed material from crop of 6-7 months age. It should be free from pest and disease. Discard pest, disease affected and damaged buds and canes. Harvest seed crop one day before planting, it will give high and uniform germination. The setts should be soaked in Carbendazim@3gm in 1litre of water. After chemical treatment treat with   Azospirillum.

Therefore weed management practices should be adopt  within 3-4 months after planting. For control of weeds, chemical is not  only solution. Adopting mechanical as well as cultural practices gives  effective solution.1) Mechanical Measure: As sugarcane is widely space  crop, weeding with hand or interculture operation can be easily carried  out. Take 3-4 hoeing after every irrigation.2) Cultural Operations: It included change in  cropping pattern, intercropping and trash mulching. Monocropping leads  to heavy infestation of weed. Crop rotation with fodder or green manure  crops suppress weeds. Also sugarcane is wider space crop so there is  opportunity for weed to grow in large numbers. If sugarcane is intercrop  with short duration crops then it will suppress the weed growth also  give additional benefit. In trash mulching, mulch of 10-12cm thickness  is provided in between cane row after emergence of cane. It will restrict  the sunlight thus help to check weed growth. It also conserved soil  moisture.3) Chemical: To control weeds, carry out  pre-emergence weedicide application with Simazine or Atrazine@600-800 g/acre or Metribuzine@ 800 g/acre or Diuron@1- 1.2 kg/acre.

In case of scanty rainfall apply irrigation with 10days interval. Afterwards increase irrigation intervals, i.e apply water with 20-25days interval. To conserved moisture in soil do mulching in between cane rows. Avoid water stress from April to June. Water stress during these days will reduce yield. Avoid water logging in standing field. Tillering stage and elongation or grand growth phase are critical for irrigation.Earthing: Soil between the furrows of canes, is taken with the help of spade and applied to the sides of the plants.

The adult beetles emerge from the soil during June-July with the first showers of rain. They congregate on the nearby trees and feed on their leaves during night. The eggs are laid in the soil and the larvae (grubs) hatching from them eat away the rootlets or root hairs of the groundnut plants. To destroy beetles spray Imidacloprid@4-6ml/10Ltr of water on plants of nearby sugarcane plants. For effective management of white grub. Plough the field and exposes the beetles resting in the soil. Do not delay crop sowing. Before sowing treat cane with Chlorpyriphos. Apply Phorate@4kg or carbofuran@13kg per acre in the soil at or before sowing.

Method of sowingseeds are sown with help of seed drill.ICRISAT method: Polythene mulching has been attributed as one of the major improved cultivation practices for enhanced productivity of groundnut in China. When grown under polythene mulch system, groundnut matures about 10 days earlier than under non-mulched condition. Polythene mulching increases the soil temperature by retaining the heat from the sun. The increased accumulated temperature shortens the crop period. During the hot season it also protects the soil from direct sunlight.In this technology, Broad beds and furrows are used for groundnut cultivation. Environment of Broad beds and furrows system is favourable for the development of groundnut pods, by doing little modification in the size, beds are formed along with polyethylene film mulched. Make beds of 60 cm width and leave 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. Polyethylene sheet of Seven micron @20kg/acre is required.

        "plat-protection": "Weed Control Weed control during first 45 days of growth period is essential for good yield. The most critical period is 3-6 weeks after sowing of crop. The average yield loss due to weed is about 30% whereas under poor management yield loss by weed may be 60%. Therefore carryout mechanical or chemical weed control during initial stage of crop growth. Give two hoeing after the first three weeks of sowing and then after second three weeks of sowing. No interculture would be done after the pegs have commmenced going underground. Apply Fluchoralin @ 600 ml per acre or Pendimethalin @ 1 ltr per acre as pre-emergence area followed by hand weeding once 36-40 days after planting.Accomplish earthing up during second hand weeding/late hand weeding (in herbicide application). It is an important operation in groundnut. Earthing up is to be done within 40-45 days after sowing as it helps for the penetration of pegs in the soil and also facilitates for increased pod development.Show MoreShow Less, Irrigation Irrigation for two or three time depending upon seasonal rainfall is necessary for good crop growth. Apply first irrigation at flowering stage. If the Kharif crop is caught in a long spell of draught, especially at the pod formation stage, supplemental irrigation is given, if water is available (In pod development stage, 2 - 3 irrigations are given depending on the soil type). Another irrigation a few days before the harvest may be given for full recovery for pods from soil.Show MoreShow Less, Plant protection     Pest and their controlAphid: Its infestation is high when rainfall is low. These are black bodied tiny insects suck the sap making the plants stunted and yellow. They secrete a sticky fluid (honeydew) on the plant, which is turned black by a fungus.It can be controlled by spraying of rogor @ 300ml/acre or Imidacloprid 17.8 % SL@ 80 ml/acre or Methyl demeton 25% EC @ 300 ml/acre as soon as the symptoms are seen.Show MoreShow Less, White grub: The adult beetles emerge from the soil during June-July with the first showers of rain. They congregate on the nearby trees such as ber, guava, rukmanjani, grapevines, almonds etc. and feed on their leaves during night. The eggs are laid in the soil and the larvae (grubs) hatching from them eat away the rootlets or root hairs of the groundnut plants.For effective management of white grub plough the field twice during May-June. It exposes the beetles resting in the soil. Do not delay crop sowing. Before sowing treat the seed with Chlorpyriphos 20E C@12.5 ml per kg kernels. For beetle control, spray with carbaryl @900 gm/100 Ltr of water. The spray should be repeated after every rainfall till the middle of July. Apply Phorate @ 4 kg or carbofuran @ 13 kg per acre in the soil at or before sowing.Show MoreShow Less, Hairy caterpillar: The caterpillars occur in masses and defoliate the crop, reducing the yield. Larvae are reddish brown with black band and reddish hairs on all over body.Set up 3-4 light traps immediately after receipts of rains. Collect and destroy egg masses in the cropped area. Avoid migration of larvae by digging a trench 30 cm deep and 25 cm wide with perpendicular sides around the infested fields. Distribute small balls of poison bait in the field during evening hours. To prepare poison bait, mix 10 kg of rice bran, 1 kg jaggery and one litre Quinalphos. To control young larvae, do dusting of Carbaryl or Quinalphos at 300 ml/acre. To control grown up caterpillar, spray with 200 ml of Dichlorvos 100 EC @200 Ltr water/acre.Show MoreShow Less, Groundnut leaf miner: Young larvae boar into the leaflets and form small purple blotch on the leaf.

Take spray of Zinc sulphate@2gm/Litre of water. Spray for two-three times with 7 days interval. Sulphur Deficiency:Young Plant growth get stunted and appeared smaller in size. Also leaves are small and give yellowish appearance. Maturity of plant get delayed. As a preventive measure apply Gypsum@200kg/acre at planting and pegging stage.Show MoreShow Less, Harvesting  Kharif sown crop is get ready to harvest in month of November. When plant show uniform yellowing of crop along with shedding of older leaves. Crop sown during April end - May end is ready for harvesting after the monsoons are over towards end of August and September. For efficient harvesting of crop, adequate moisture should be present in soil and crop should not be overripe. The tractor- mounted groundnut-digger shaker developed at the Punjab Agricultural University may be used for quick harvesting. Harvested plants are stacked for a few days for drying and stripped afterwards. After curing, collect the crop at one place and give 2-3 shakings and beatings daily for 2 to 3 days with a toothed rake or trangli to separate pods and leaves from the stalk. Collect the pods and leaves into a heap and winnow. Dried pods in sun for 4 or 5 days before storage. On cloudy days removed pods and then immediately place them in an air drier@27-38 degree centigrade for 2 days or until pods dry to constant mass (6-8%).Show MoreShow Less, Post-Harvest After cleaning and grading, store pods in gunny bags and stack them up to 10 bags high in separated stocks so that air freely circulate among them. The bags should be piled on wooden plank to avoid damage due to dampness.

It is grown in all cropping seasons in different parts of country. More than 90% of area is under rainfed conditions, grown during kharif season. In Uttaranchal it normally grown in June.SpacingHigher or lower yield than optimum population will lower down the yield. For optimum population, use spacing of 25x15 cm (25 cm between row and 15 cm plant to plant distance) Sowing Depthseed should not be sown less than 3-4 cm deep.Method of sowingSowing can be done manually by: BroadcastingLine sowingDrilling Transplantation in fieldShow MoreShow Less",
        "seed": "Seed Seed RateIn order to get higher yield, a plant population of 1.6-2 lakh per acre is optimum and seed rate of 4 kg/acre for sowing in main field. Maintain optimum plant population in field by doing gap filling and thinning operation in field. After 20-27 days of sowing, when plants are established in field, thinning operation means removing of excess seedling is necessary. Similarly, where ever plant population is not uniform, gap filling with 20-25 days seedlings should be used.Seed TreatmentSoak seed in water (one litre water for every kg of seeds) for 6 hours. Drain the water and tightly tied the seeds in wet cloth bag for two days. After two days remove seeds from wet cloth bag, they will show some sign of germination. Dry them in shade for two days.

For dwarf high yielding varieties, give pre sowing irrigation. For heavy soils, four to six irrigations are required whereas for light soils 6-8 irrigations are necessary. Under limited water supply apply irrigation only at critical stage. When water is available for only one irrigation, then apply at crown root initiation stage. When two irrigations are available then apply at crown root initiation and flowering stage. Where three irrigations are possible, 1st irrigation should be given at CRI stage and 2nd at late jointing (boot) and 3rd at milking stage. CRI stage is most important stage for irrigation. It has been found that each week delay in 1st irrigation from CRI stage results in yield reduction of 83-125kg per acre.First irrigation should be given 20-25 days after sowing. This is crown root initiation stage and moisture stress at this stage will lead to yield loss. At tillering stage within 40-45 days after sowing, apply second irrigation.

Brown rust is characterized by reddish- brown spores that occur in oval or elongated pustules. The disease can develop rapidly when free moisture is available and temperatures are near 20   C. Successive generations of urediospores can be produced every 10-14 days if conditions are favourable.For control of this disease, follow mixed cropping with suitable crops. Avoid excessive use of Nitrogen fertilizer. Spray Zineb Z-78@400 gm/acre or Propiconazole@2ml/Litre of water.Show MoreShow Less, Stripe/Yellow rust: The ideal growth conditions for yellow rust are temperatures of between 8-13   C for spore germination and penetration, and 12-15   C for further development and with free water. The yield penalties from yellow rust in wheat can range from 5% to as high as 30% in high disease pressure scenarios. The pustules of stripe rust, which, contain yellow to orange-yellow urediospores, usually form narrow stripes on the leaves.For control of this disease, use rust resistant variety. Follow crop rotation and adopt mix cropping pattern. Avoid excess use of Nitrogen. When symptom observed, do dusting of Sulphur @5-10 kg/acre or take spray of Mancozeb @ 2 gm/Ltr or spray the crop with Propiconazole (Tilt) 25 EC @2 ml / litre of water.

For management of this disease, take one spray of Propiconazole (Tilt 25 EC) @2ml/ Ltr of water at ear head emergence stage.  Show MoreShow Less, Harvesting  Harvesting of high yielding dwarf variety is carried out when leaves and stem turn yellow and become fairly dry. To avoid loss in yield crop should be harvested before it is dead ripe. Timely harvesting is needed for optimum quality and consumer acceptance. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to 25-30%. For manual harvesting use serrate edge sickles. Combines harvester are also available which can do harvesting, threshing and winnowing of wheat crop in single operation.Show MoreShow Less, Post-Harvest After manual harvesting, dried crops for three to four days on threshing floor so that moisture content of grain comes down to 10-12% and then threshing is done by trampling bullocks or thresher attached to bullocks. Direct sun drying and excessive drying should be avoided and the grains should be packed in sound clean gunny bags to minimize the losses. The Hapur tekka is a cylindrical rubberized cloth structure supported by bamboo poles on a metal tube base, and has a small hole in the bottom through which grain can be removed. Large scale grain storage is done in CAP (Cover and Plinth) and silos. To keep away several pest and disease during storage, use 1% malathion solution for disinfection of gunny bags. Properly clean the storage house, remove the cracks and fill the rat burrows with cement. White wash the storage house before storing grains and spray Malathion 50 EC @ 3 Ltr/100 Sq. meters. Place the heap of bags 50 cm away from wall and in between the heaps give some gaps. Also there should be a gap between the roof and the bags.Show MoreShow Less, References 1.Punjab Agricultural University Ludhiana2.Department of Agriculture3.Indian Agricultural Research Instittute, New Delhi4.Indian  Institute  of  Wheat and Barley  Research5.Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers WelfareShow MoreShow Less"

Corn is ready for harvest when the ear is full size for the variety, has a tight husk, and has somewhat dried silks. The kernels are fully developed and exude a milky liquid when punctured. Delay harvesting causes reduction in sugar content. Whether harvesting is done by hand or machine, sweet corn should be collected at night or early in the morning.Baby Corn: Ears are harvested 45-50 days after emergence, when silks are 1-2 cm long (within 1-2 days after silk emergence). Harvesting is carried out in morning when temperature is low and moisture is high. The picking of baby corn should to be done once in three days and generally 7-8 pickings are required depending on genotypes used.Pop Corn: Leave ears of Popcorn on the plant for as long as possible. If the weather allows, leave them in the field until the husks are dry and papery.Show MoreShow Less, Post-Harvest Sweet corn must be moved quickly from the field to packing sheds, where it should be rapidly sorted, packed, and cooled.

Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. Grains provides food items which are consumed in the form of starch, corn flakes also glucose. It is also used as animal feed in poultry. Maize can be cultivated in any soil as they require less fertile soil and various chemicals. Moreover, it fetch less ripening span, 3 months, in comparison to paddy, which takes 145 days.By growing maize, farmers can easily shield the deteriorating grade of soil , preserve 90% of water and 70% of potency as compared with paddy and can make more profit than wheat and paddy,   reported by vice chancellor, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. It serves as basic raw material to thousands of industrial products like oil, starch, alcoholic beverages etc. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J & K and Punjab are major maize growing states.

Do Soil drenching with Captan at basal internode (5-7week growth stage)@1gm/Ltr of water.Show MoreShow Less, Pest and their controlStalk borer or stem borer: Chilo partellus, commonly known as stalk borer that appears throughout the monsoon time period. It is a serious bug all over the nation. Chilo lays eggs 10-25 nights after germination on inferior portion of the leaf. The larva gets into in the whorl and then triggers deterioration in the leaf and cause shot hole. Larva of stem borer is yellowish brown with a brown head.For stem borer, release egg parasitoid Trichogramma chilonis@1,00,000/acre coinciding egg laying period. Three releases at weekly interval are desirable. Third release is to be accompanied with larval parasitoid Cotesia flavipes@ 2000/acre.Mix Phorate 10%CG@4kg/acre or Carbaryl 4%G@1kg/acre with sand to make up total quantity of 10kg and apply in the leaf whorls on the 20th day of sowing. Or Spray insecticide like Carbaryl 50WP@1 kg/acre on the 20th day of sowing or Dimethoate 30% EC@200ml/acre. Spray of Chlorpyriphos@1-1.5ml/Ltr of water at 10-12 days after germination provides good control.  Show MoreShow Less, Pink Borer (Sesamia inference): It inference arises in times of the winter season mainly in peninsular India. Larvae of the pink borer cause damage by feeding on all parts of maize plant except roots. The larvae form circular or   S   shaped tunnels filled with excreta inside the stem and, also show exit holes on the surface. In case of severe damage, breaking of stem occurred. Seed treatment with Carbofuran (40F) 5% W/W @ 2.5g/kg of seed was also found effective. The Chilo can be regulated by introduction of 4 Trichocards (Trichogramma chilonis) per acre at ten days after germination. Light and pheromone traps can be used to assess the incidence of adult moths.Show MoreShow Less, Corn worm: Larva feeds on silk and developing grains. Larva of corn worms shows colour variation from greenish to brown. It has dark brown grey lines on the body with lateral white lines.Set up pheromone traps at @5/acre. Apply Carbaryl 10D @10kg/acre or Malathion 5D@10kg/acre on 3rd and 18th day after panicle emergence.  Show MoreShow Less, Shoot bug: Shoot bug laid eggs inside leaf tissue and covered with a white waxy substance. Due to infestation plant become unhealthy, stunted and yellow. The leaves wither from top to downwards. The midribs of the leaves turn red due to egg-laying and may dry up subsequently. If infestation is observed take spray of Dimethoate@2ml/Ltr of water.Show MoreShow Less, Termites: Serious pest of maize observed in most areas. To control apply Fipronil@8kg/acre followed by light irrigation. If the termite incidence is in patches, than spot application of Fipronil@2-3kg granuled/plant should be done.

It causes damage at seedling stage and causes drying of seedling or dead heart. To control shoot fly infestation, Plough land after harvesting of previous crop also remove stubbles and remains of previously harvested crop. Do seed treatment with Imidacloprid @ 6ml/kg of seeds, it provides good control of the shoot fly. Soil application of Phorate 10%CG@5kg/acre at the time of sowing. Spray any one of pesticide like Dimethoate 30%EC@300 ml/acre or Methyl demeton 25%EC@450ml/acre.Show MoreShow Less, Fall armyworm:  They young larvae damages the crop by scrapping the leaf surface and ends up making them papery and the young larvae feed themselves by eating the leaves which results in round to oblong holes. Larvae can be identified by seeing white-coloured inverted Y-shaped mark on the head and four spots arranged in square pattern at the end of the tail.Control:  Try to sow the crop at recommended time. For 20 days old crop, spray coragen@0.4ml/ltr water or Delegate@0.5ml/ltr water. Thereafter for older crop, the amount of dosage and water needs to be increased.  Show MoreShow Less, Deficiency and their remedy Zinc Deficiency mostly observed in areas having use of high yielding variety. Broad band of white-yellow along with reddish veins are appeared on each side of mid rib on second or third leaf from top of plant. To overcome zinc deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate@10 kg/acre at time of sowing. If deficiency is observed in standing field, apply Zinc Sulphate and mixed with equal quantity of dry soils and apply along the rows. Magnesium DeficiencyCommon is maize crop. Mostly observed on leaves. Basel leaves give yellowish appearance between edge and veins of leaves. As a preventive measure foliar spray of Magnesium Sulphate@1kg/acre in maize.Iron DeficiencyWhole plant give yellowish appearance. As a preventive measure for Iron deficiency, apply mixture of Micro-Nutrient@25 kg/acre along with sand@18 kg/acre after sowing of maize crop.Show MoreShow Less, Harvesting  Harvesting should be done when cobs outer cover turns from green to white. The optimum time of harvesting maize is when the stalks have dried and moisture of grain as about 17-20%. Drying place or equipment should be dry, clean and disinfected.  Sweet corn harvesting: When crops come nears to maturity, examined a few ears daily to determine the time for the first picking. Corn is ready for harvest when the ear is full size for the variety, has a tight husk, and has somewhat dried silks. The kernels are fully developed and exude a milky liquid when punctured. Delay harvesting causes reduction in sugar content. Whether harvesting is done by hand or machine, sweet corn should be collected at night or early in the morning. Baby corn: Ears are harvested 45-50 days after emergence, when silks are 1-2 cm long (within 1-2 days after silk emergence). Harvesting is carried out in morning when temperature is low and moisture is high. The picking of baby corn should be done once in three days and generally 7-8 pickings are required depending on genotypes used.  Pop corn: Leave ears of popcorn on the plant for as long as possible. If the weather allows, leave them in the field until the husks are dry and papery.Show MoreShow Less, Post-Harvest Sweet corn must be moved quickly from the field to packing sheds, where it should be rapidly sorted, packed, and cooled. It is generally packed in wire bound wooden crates, which can hold from 4 to 6 dozen ears, depending on the size of the crate or ears.Show MoreShow Less, References 1.Punjab Agricultural University Ludhiana2.Department of Agriculture3.Indian Agricultural Research Instittute, New Delhi4.Indian  Institute  of  Wheat and Barley  Research5.Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers WelfareShow MoreShow Less"
